## Assignments
### [Assignment 1](https://github.com/Yuylam/semester-1/blob/main/programming-techniques-1/Assignment%201%20GOE%20JIE%20YING%20LAM%20YOKE%20YU.pdf)
Analyse problem and design its solution using a flowchart
1. BMR calculator
2. Car loan calculator

### [Exercise 2](https://github.com/Yuylam/semester-1/blob/main/programming-techniques-1/Exercise%202%20LAM%20YOKE%20YU.cpp)
Practice on arithmetic operations

### Assignment 2
Build the C++ program based on the flowchart created in Assignment 1.
1. [BMR calculator](https://github.com/Yuylam/semester-1/blob/main/programming-techniques-1/Assignment%202%20Set%201%20GOE%20JIE%20YING%20LAM%20YOKE%20YU.cpp)
2. [Car loan calculator](https://github.com/Yuylam/semester-1/blob/main/programming-techniques-1/Assignment%202%20Set%202%20GOE%20JIE%20YING%20LAM%20YOKE%20YU.cpp)

### [Exercise 3](https://github.com/Yuylam/semester-1/blob/main/programming-techniques-1/Exercise%203%20LAM%20YOKE%20YU.cpp)
- Practice on functions
- Write a complete C++ program that helps the Ministry of Health (MOH) to determine the status of a zone by calculating the number of active cases for COVID 19.

### [Exercise 4](https://github.com/Yuylam/semester-1/blob/main/programming-techniques-1/Exercise%204%20LAM%20YOKE%20YU.cpp)
- Practice on arrays and files
- Write a complete C++ program that reads in a list of temperature(F) data from a text file, calculate the respective temperature in degree Celsius and finally prints a summary output on and screen and a detailed output into a file.

### Case Study
- We shall select 2 cases out of 3 for our case study
1. [Case 2](https://github.com/Yuylam/semester-1/tree/main/programming-techniques-1/Case%202) is a program that grades the final exam of students
2. [Case 3](https://github.com/Yuylam/semester-1/tree/main/programming-techniques-1/Case%203) is a program that helps to analyse the sales of a company

## Reflection
I great joy in the programming process. Producing a program that can help to simplify work is so much fun. Beyond the assignments we tackle in class, , I've also wrote some programs for stuffs that interest me. Some of these projects are housed in the [random-projects repository](https://github.com/Yuylam/random-projects), while others may not beâ€”feel free to check them out!
