### Assignment 1
Analyse problem and design its solution using a [flowchart](https://github.com/Yuylam/semester-1/blob/6bb359be888c374f23b2671ea579c3059f7c11ef/programming-techniques-1/Assignment%201%20GOE%20JIE%20YING%20LAM%20YOKE%20YU.pdf)
1. BMR calculator
2. Car loan calculator

### Exercise 2
Practice on [arithmetic operations](https://github.com/Yuylam/semester-1/blob/e9dcfcebc4da5363b4a3f7d7f6d92f8acaeaea12/programming-techniques-1/Exercise%202%20LAM%20YOKE%20YU.cpp)

### Assignment 2
Build the C++ program based on the flowchart created in Assignment 1.
1. [BMR calculator](https://github.com/Yuylam/semester-1/blob/e9dcfcebc4da5363b4a3f7d7f6d92f8acaeaea12/programming-techniques-1/Assignment%202%20Set%201%20GOE%20JIE%20YING%20LAM%20YOKE%20YU.cpp)
2. [Car loan calculator](https://github.com/Yuylam/semester-1/blob/e9dcfcebc4da5363b4a3f7d7f6d92f8acaeaea12/programming-techniques-1/Assignment%202%20Set%202%20GOE%20JIE%20YING%20LAM%20YOKE%20YU.cpp)

### Exercise 3
- Practice on [functions](https://github.com/Yuylam/semester-1/blob/e9dcfcebc4da5363b4a3f7d7f6d92f8acaeaea12/programming-techniques-1/Exercise%203%20LAM%20YOKE%20YU.cpp)
- Write a complete C++ program that helps the Ministry of Health (MOH) to determine the status of a zone by calculating the number of active cases for COVID 19.

### Exercise 4
- Practice on [arrays and files](https://github.com/Yuylam/semester-1/blob/fb9c2017b994b064598d63cfe1caf2e2da9ac019/programming-techniques-1/Exercise%204%20LAM%20YOKE%20YU.cpp)
- Write a complete C++ program that reads in a list of temperature(F) data from a text file, calculate the respective temperature in degree Celsius and finally prints a summary output on and screen and a detailed output into a file.

## Reflection
I great joy in the programming process. Producing a program that can help to simplify work is so much fun. Beyond the assignments we tackle in class, , I've also wrote some programs for stuffs that interest me. Some of these projects are housed in the random-projects repository, while others may not beâ€”feel free to check them out!
