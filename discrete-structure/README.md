## Reflection
I really like this subject, particularly graph theory and finite automata. Djikstra's Shortest Path Algorithm reminds me of the Travelling Salesman Problem that I came across previously. Although the Djikstra's Algorithm is not directly applicable to the Travelling Salesman Problem (as it is a Hamiltonian Circuit), I am fascinated by the elegance of the algorithm.  

The final chapter of the course is equally captivating, focusing on Deterministic Finite Automata and Finite State Machines. It is just like the state diagram that we studied in Digital Logic, making the connections between different areas of study within the broader field of computer science apparent.  

I am intrigued by how these discrete structures and algorithms have practical applications in problem-solving and computational processes. I am looking forward to explore more in the future!
